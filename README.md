# JailExpert

![method]()

This is the official repository for our paper [Stand on The Shoulders of Giants: Building JailExpert from Previous Attack Experience]().

we propose the **JailExpert**, an automated jailbreak framework, which is the first to achieve a formal representation of experience structure, group experiences based on semantic drift, and support the dynamic up dating of the experience pool. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JailExpert significantly improves both attack effectiveness and efficiency. Compared to the current state-of the-art black-box jailbreak methods, JailExpert achieves an average increase of **17%** in attack success rate and **2.7 times** improvement in attack efficiency. Please refer to our [paper]() for more details.

## Quick Start

### Setup

We require [test](1) for quick evaluation and the latest FastChat for searching on Llama3. Follow these steps to set up the required dependencies:

Then, install the remaining dependencies:

### Searching code

#### Data Construction

We provide a script to construct search data for GCG-Adaptive and our method:

```shell
cd 
```

#### Running the Search Script

We build upon the GCG attack framework and integrate our method. Use the following commands to run the search:

```shell
bash 
```

Remember to change the running config in `./scripts/configs`

#### Post Processing

We provide scripts to extract adversarial prompts from log files and combine them with test questions and model chat templates:

```shell
python
```

### Generation

After searching for the adversarial attack prompt, we provide a script supporting batch generation to get the response of the model. Remember to change the model/tokenizer path and the input/output path.

```shell
cd
```

### Evaluation

We support evaluation using `AISafetyLab`. Run the evaluation script as follows:

```shell
cd
```
